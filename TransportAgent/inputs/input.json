          "description": "This is a complete list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain for the year 1766.\nFor acts passed until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland. See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts passed from 1801 onwards, see the list of acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. For acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3. c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".\nActs passed by the Parliament of Great Britain did not have a short title; however, some of these acts have subsequently been given a short title by acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (such as the Short Titles Act 1896).\nBefore the Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793 came into force on 8 April 1793, acts passed by the Parliament of Great Britain were deemed to have come into effect on the first day of the session in which they were passed. Because of this, the years given in the list below may in fact be the year before a particular act was passed.",

          "description": "The Agra Fort (Qila Agra) is a historical Mughal fort in the city of Agra, also known as  Agra's Red Fort. Mughal emperor Humayun was crowned at this fort in 1530. It was later renovated by the Mughal emperor Akbar from 1565 and the present-day structure was completed in 1573. It served as the main residence of the rulers of the Mughal dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. It was also known as the \"Lal-Qila\" or \"Qila-i-Akbari\". Before being captured by the British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas. In 1983, the Agra fort was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its importance during Mughal rule. It is about 2.5 kilometers (1.6 mi) northwest of its more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more accurately described as a walled city. It was later renovated by Shah Jahan.\nLike the rest of Agra, the history of Agra Fort prior to Mahmud of Ghazni's invasion is unclear. However, in the 15th century, the Chauhan Rajputs occupied it. Soon after, Agra assumed the status of capital when Sikandar Khan Lodi (14871517 CE) shifted his capital from Delhi and constructed a few buildings in the preexisting fort at Agra. After the first battle of Panipat (1526 CE), Mughals captured the fort and ruled from it. In 1530 CE, Humayun was crowned in it. The fort was given its present appearance during the reign of Akbar (15561605 CE). Later, this fort was under the rule of Jats of Bharatpur for 13 years.",

          "description": "Burnt ends are pieces of meat cut from the \"point\" half of a smoked brisket.\nWhen brisket muscles are separated, the lean \"first cut\" or \"flat cut\" is the deep pectoral, while the fattier \"point\", also known as the \"second cut\", \"fat end\", or \"triangular cut\", is the superficial pectoral. A traditional part of Kansas City-style barbecue, burnt ends are considered a delicacy in barbecue cooking.  Either the entire brisket is cooked whole, then the point end is removed and cooked further, or the point and flat are separated prior to cooking. Due to the higher fat content of the brisket point, it takes longer to fully cook to tender and render out fat and collagen. This longer cooking gave rise to the name \"burnt ends\". Sometimes when the flat is done, the point is returned to the smoker for further cooking. Some cooks re-season the point at this time.   \nKansas City style burnt ends are usually served chopped with sauce either on top or on the side. A \"proper\" burnt end should display a modest amount of \"bark\" or char on at least one side. Burnt ends can be served alone (sometimes smothered in barbecue sauce) or in sandwiches, as well as in a variety of other dishes, including baked beans and French fries.\nThe origin of Burnt Ends is credited to the Kansas City restaurant Arthur Bryant's and its' namesake pitmaster. Kansas City native Calvin Trillin is credited with popularizing burnt ends through his references to the burnt ends at Bryant's in his work. In a 1972 article he wrote for Playboy about Arthur Bryant's restaurant in Kansas City, he wrote: \"The main course at Bryant's, as far as I'm concerned, is something that is given away free  the burned edges of the brisket. The counterman just pushes them over to the side and anyone who wants them helps himself. I dream of those burned edges. Sometimes, when Im in some awful, overpriced restaurant in some strange town, trying to choke down some three-dollar hamburger that tastes like a burned sponge, a blank look comes over me: I have just realized that at that very moment, someone in Kansas City is being given those burned edges for free.",
